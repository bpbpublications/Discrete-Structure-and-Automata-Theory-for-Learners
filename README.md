## About the Book
This book's purpose is to provide a modern and comprehensive introduction to the subject of Discrete Structures and Automata Theory. Discrete structures, also called Discrete Mathematics, are an exciting and active subject, particularly due to its extreme relevance to both Mathematics and Computer Science and Algorithms. This subject forms a common foundation for rigorous Mathematical, Logical Reasoning and Proofs, as well as a formal introduction to abstract objects that are essential tools in an assortment of applications and effective computer implementations. Computing skills are now an integral part of almost all the Scientific fields, and students are very enthusiastic about being able to harness the full computing power of these tools. Further, this book also deep dives into the Automata Theory with various examples that illustrate the basic concepts and is substantiated with multiple diagrams. The book's vital feature is that it contains the practical implementation of the Automata Machine example through the JFLAP Tool. Courses on Discrete Structures and Automata theory are offered at most universities and colleges.
